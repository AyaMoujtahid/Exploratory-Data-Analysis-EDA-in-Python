# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

## Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python. The analysis involves cleaning the data, identifying patterns, visualizing key features, and extracting insights that are essential for better understanding the dataset.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Identifies and handles missing or inconsistent data.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Includes descriptive statistics and data visualizations to uncover trends and relationships.
- **Visualizations**: Implements various graphical representations to showcase distribution, correlation, and other key insights.
- **Tools and Libraries**:
  - Python
  - Pandas for data handling
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations
  - NumPy for numerical operations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eda-in-python.git
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

- Open the `eda-in-python.ipynb` notebook to run the exploratory analysis on the provided dataset (`data.csv`).
- Ensure the dataset is in the same directory as the notebook to avoid file path issues.

## Notebooks

1. **eda-in-python.ipynb**: Contains the entire process of EDA, including data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is included as `data.csv`. It contains [brief description of the dataset content].

## Visualization Highlights

- Distribution plots for numerical features
- Correlation heatmaps to understand feature relationships
- Scatter plots to show trends and outliers
